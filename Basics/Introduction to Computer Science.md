## **3. OSI Model (7 Layers of Networking)**

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model defines how communication occurs between two devices. It is composed of **7 layers**:

1. **Physical Layer**: The physical connection between devices (cables, switches).
2. **Data Link Layer**: Manages the movement of data within the same network (MAC addresses).
3. **Network Layer**: Routes the data across networks (IP addresses).
4. **Transport Layer**: Ensures reliable data transmission (TCP/UDP).
5. **Session Layer**: Manages the sessions between network connections.
6. **Presentation Layer**: Translates the data into a format the application can understand.
7. **Application Layer**: The layer closest to the user, such as email clients, web browsers.

## **5. Blockchain**

### **What is Blockchain?**
Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across many computers. It is primarily known for its role in **cryptocurrency** like Bitcoin, but its applications go far beyond finance.

### **Key Features of Blockchain**:
- **Decentralization**: No central authority controls the network.
- **Immutability**: Once data is written, it cannot be altered.
- **Transparency**: Everyone has access to the same version of the ledger.

### **Applications of Blockchain**:
- **Cryptocurrency**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others use blockchain for secure transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with the terms written in code.
- **Supply Chain**: Track the origin and movement of goods with immutable records.

## **OSI Model: 7 Layers of Networking**

The OSI model is a framework that standardizes communication functions. It consists of **7 layers**, divided into **hardware layers** and **software layers**:

1. **Physical Layer**: Manages physical connections between devices, transmitting raw data.
2. **Data Link Layer**: Ensures data transfer within the same network using MAC addresses.
3. **Network Layer**: Routes data between networks using IP addresses.
4. **Transport Layer**: The "heart" of OSI, ensures reliable data delivery with protocols like TCP and UDP.
5. **Session Layer**: Manages communication sessions between devices.
6. **Presentation Layer**: Translates data formats and handles encryption and compression.
7. **Application Layer**: Interacts with the user through applications like web browsers and email.

## **7. Databases**

### **What is a Database?**
A **database** is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically. It allows for data storage, management, and retrieval.

### **Types of Databases**:
- **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**: Store data in tables and use SQL for querying (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **NoSQL Databases**: Flexible schema databases, ideal for large-scale applications (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
